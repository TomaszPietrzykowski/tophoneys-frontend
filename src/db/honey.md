# About honey

Honey is one of nature's most valuable nutrients and medicinal substances. It consists mainly of simple sugars, it is extremely easily absorbed by the human body. In addition to carbohydrates, it contains acids, protein, enzymes, bactericidal substances, vitamins from group B and A, C and K, all amino acids and about 30 macro- and microelements (the most important of them are iron, manganese, cobalt and magnesium), it also contains inhibin, (a substance that inhibits the growth of bacteria and kills some of its strains).

All these ingredients are very valuable for humans, thanks to their extraordinary properties (antibacterial, regenerating, detoxifying, nutritional and healing properties), honey strengthens the body physically and mentally, improves immunity and gives energy.

Honey should be consumed by children and adolescents, because it has a very positive effect on the body, increases the overall immunity of the body and improves mental development.

Can honey go bad? The answer is quite simple: If it's real and pure, it won't spoil for many years. Hydrogen peroxide is responsible for its amazing durability. This substance is the result of the oxidation of glucose to glulonic acid. We owe this reaction to the bees. This process is possible thanks to a special enzyme called invertase, contained in bees' saliva. Additional protection is provided by flavonoids - these are compounds with fungicidal, antibacterial and antioxidant properties.
Attention. We can easily spoil the honey. It often happens that we put a knife or a teaspoon in a jar of honey with the remnants of other substances, such as butter or jam. In fact, they can go bad, giving an entire jar of honey a bad taste and spoiling it forever.
What we can do when the honey crystallizes? (doesn't mean there is something wrong with your honey ) It is enough to heat it up a bit (being very careful about the temperature that destroys the valuable properties of honey), it will change its consistency to a liquid.
